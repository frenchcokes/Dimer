Introduction:
Deamon
Good morning, my man! Are you ready for your first day of work at the mine?

Don't worry, you'll get comfortable with it very soon.

I'll tell you the basics of mining. No need to be panic!

It is easy. I mastered it when I was a kid.

[Instructions on key and mouse operations]

The deeper you are into the mine, the more valuable ores you will find.

And eventually, you will reach the bottom - the world's biggest diamond mine!

[Instructions on on-ground mechanism]

Would you like me to repeat that?

[No]

That's the spirit, my lad! Work hard and feed your family,

A whole new life lies ahead!

[1 - first time]
Before you sell me anything, I'd like to repeat our rules, just to confirm.

All the items that you sell me will be sold for their *values*.

To translate these *values* into real money, you will be tested on your innate *fortune*.

If your *fortune* permits, not only you get the money that the *values* deserve, the money can also be *multiplied*...

But, if you are *unfortunate*, you might as well get *nothing*.

Do you understand and accept the rules?

[Yes]

Perfect!

You'll know the details when as we do it...

You can always sell your items to me.

Minerals, stones, or maybe just some scraps in your house, whatever you want to exchange for money.

I know I am doing an unconventional business. Not a lot of businessmen make deals like I do.

Trust me, you will like my way better than anything else.

[3]
You are such a lucky man to live around the biggest diamond mine in the world!

My friends in the mining industry have confirmed it.

And most importantly, it hasn't been disclosed to the public yet. Not a lot of people know it.

But remember, it won't take long before it reaches to the news.

You gotta be fast to sell your diamonds before they lose their values

I am glad to hear that!

I can't wait to see our family get rich again...

Don't overwork yourself, okay?

Can you mind ice cream there?

Dad, can we go to the town more often?
